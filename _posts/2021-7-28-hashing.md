# Hashing and Encryption

When we think of encryption, we most often think in the context of two-way functions, which allow us to put a message into an (ideally) indecipherable form for safe keeping until access is needed by an authorized party, who can then decrypt it back into a readable format. If I use a cipher to send a secret message to a friend, then the ability of my friend to reverse the encryption and read the message is just as important as the ability to make it inaccessible to interceptors—otherwise, there’s not much point. A cipher that only operated in one direction and couldn’t be reversed would be useless. Right?

Not necessarily. In mathematics and computer science we do in fact have what are called one-way functions, also known as hashing or hash functions, which convert a given text, file, or other piece of information into an unreadable form that cannot be reversed. There are no keys, no decryption, and no cryptanalysis. The result is a very different tool with a very different use case from typical encryption.

To better understand hashing, let’s look at an example. There are many common hash algorithms available such as MD-5 and SHA-256; today we’ll work with SHA-1.

When we type the text string “hello” (quotation marks not included), the generator gives us a result of AAF4C61DDCC5E8A2DABEDE0F3B482CD9AEA9434D. You can verify this for yourself; by typing in “hello” exactly as I have here, you’ll see that you will receive the same result. You will get this same result with any SHA-1 hash generator you might find, whether in a software program or elsewhere on the internet. There are important implications to this that we will discuss later.

Now let’s try a slight change—we’ll add an exclamation mark to the end, making the string “hello!” (again, without quotation marks). Now let’s see the result:

As you can see, the hash is completely different. Now let’s make it even more interesting—instead of a single word, what happens if we input an entire paragraph? Lorem Ipsum will be perfect for testing this, so let’s see what happens:

So here we have the SHA-1 hash for Lorem Ipsum. Noticeably, the size of the hash value for this entire paragraph is the same length as the hash values for a single word. This is because a hash function maps data inputs of arbitrary size into fixed-length outputs. The size of the input string or file never changes the size of the output hash value. Now let’s try something even more interesting: we’re going to change a single letter of this paragraph, and see if anything happens.

I deleted a single letter from the paragraph and the hash output changed dramatically! Now that we’ve seen how this works in practice, let’s consider some prominent use cases.

Hashing functions can be used with more than just text, as they can also be applied to entire files of various kinds. This can be useful for verifying the integrity of a given file. We often download and run software via the Internet from vendors that we trust, but how do we know that the file hasn’t been tampered with by a threat actor? Hashes come to the rescue here, because we can compare the hash of the file we have with what the developer has told us it is supposed to be (we usually call this a "checksum"). If an attacker has found some way to modify the files we are receiving, then any changes they have made to the coding will cause the hash output to be different, and this can alert us that something may be wrong. Below are some checksums that can be used to verify the integrity of an NMap download, a popular network reconnaisance tool:

Another extremely powerful use for hashing is for password verification. Passwords have to be stored somewhere on a system in order to be used to verify a login—but what happens if a hacker gets access to the list of stored passwords? We need some way to ensure that we have access to passwords for verifications while also knowing that they cannot be leveraged by attackers if found. Hashing allows us to do exactly this. By storing the hash output of a given password—which we know will always give us a fixed result—we have an elegant way to verify that a password is correct *without having to know what the password is*. And since a hash cannot be reversed or decrypted, it does an attacker little good to have access to the hashed password.

Or at least, that’s the ideal case. In the real world, hashed passwords still have weaknesses, the main one being rainbow tables. We’ve seen already that, for a given hashing algorithm, the same input will always get the same result. What this means is that even though a hash cannot be reversed or decrypted, it can be precomputed. By taking a database of as many potential passwords as possible and their corresponding hash outputs—also known as a rainbow table—an attacker can compare a captured file of hashed passwords to a list of known outputs in order to find a potential match. Rainbow tables also have the advantage of requiring very little processing power to use, although the tradeoff is that they do require considerable storage space because of the sheer number of precomputed outputs they must have in order to be effective. 

Fortunately we can hamstring rainbow tables by using salts. A salt is a random or pseudorandom string combined with the password before hashing to ensure a different final result. Not only does this prevent passwords in the database from matching precomputed hashes, it also ensure that even identical passwords from different users appear different in the database, because each password is given a different salt.

Here's a simplified illustration of how a salt functions:

This post only scratches the surface of all that there is to know about hashing algorithms. However, hopefully this broad overview has given you a good overview of how this technology works and why it is so useful.
